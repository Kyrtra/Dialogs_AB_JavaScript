</div><p><q><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien/">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</a> </b> CBE FRSL (/ˈruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/, ROOL TOL-keen;[a] 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, philologist, and academic, best known as the author of the high fantasy works <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
  
    After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including <i>The Silmarillion</i> These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth.[b] Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.
    
    While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.</p></head></html></q>
