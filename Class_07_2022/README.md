<h2>Javascript Notes</h2>

<u>One of the ways to insert JS is  in the html document:</u>
<p>In HTML, you can insert JavaScript code  between <.script> and <./script> tags.</p>

<u>Other way is to make an external JS just like CSS:</u>
<p>You can place an external script reference in <.head> or <.body> as you like.
The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <.script> tag is located. External scripts cannot contain <.script> tags.</p>
