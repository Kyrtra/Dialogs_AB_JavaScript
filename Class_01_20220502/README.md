 >### [What is a .md file?](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/what-is-a-md-file/)
 > A .md file is a plain-text document that contains no other elements. The text can be formatted usingspecial inline text symbols. For example, if you want a word or paragraph to be displayed in bold, you need to type two asterisks before and after it. The “MD” in the .md file extension (also written as .markdown) stands for “Markdown documentation”. Markdown is a lightweight markup language, and each MD file is written in a particular “flavor” of Markdown. It can be helpful to think of the different flavors as being like different dialects of one language.
